# Day 2: Variables and Data Types

In Day 2 of our JavaScript learning journey, we will explore the concept of variables and data types. Understanding how to work with variables and different data types is essential for building robust JavaScript applications.

## Topics Covered
- Introduction to variables

In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They are declared using the var, let, or const keyword, followed by the variable name. Here's an example:
```
var message; // Variable declaration
message = "Hello, world!"; // Variable assignment
```

- Basic data types in JavaScript
JavaScript supports various data types, including:

## Strings
Used for storing text
``` 
var name = "John Doe";
 ```
## Numbers
Used for storing numeric values.
```
var age = 25;
```

## Booleans
Used for storing true or false values.

```
var isStudent = true;

```
## Arrays
Used for storing multiple values in a single variable.
```
var hobbies = ["reading", "coding", "gaming"];

```
## Objects
Used for storing key-value pairs.

```
var person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 25,
  isStudent: true
};

```

## Exercise For You
To reinforce your understanding of variables and data types, try the following exercises:

1. Declare a variable called `greeting` and assign it the value "Hello, world!". Output the value of `greeting` to the console.

2. Declare a variable called `number` and assign it a numeric value of your choice. Output the value of `number` to the console.

3. Declare a variable called `isRaining` and assign it a boolean value indicating whether it is currently raining or not. Output the value of `isRaining` to the console.

4. Declare an array called `fruits` with the values "apple", "banana", and "orange". Output the `fruits` array to the console.

5. Declare an object called `person` with properties `name`, `age`, and `isStudent` with values of your choice. Output the `person` object to the console.

Feel free to experiment with different variable names, values, and data types to solidify your understanding.
