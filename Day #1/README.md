# Day 1: Introduction to JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for web development. It enables you to add interactivity, dynamic content, and functionality to web pages.

## Setting Up JavaScript
To get started with JavaScript, you need a text editor to write your code and a web browser to run and test it. You can use any text editor of your choice like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.

## JavaScript Syntax and Output
JavaScript code is typically embedded within HTML files using `<script>` tags. Here's an example of a simple JavaScript program that displays a message in the browser console:

```<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First JavaScript Program</title>
    <script>
      // JavaScript code
      console.log("Hello, world!");
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- HTML content -->
  </body>
</html>
```
## JavaScript Variables
Variables are used to store and manipulate data in JavaScript. Here's an example that demonstrates variable declaration, assignment, and output:


```<html>
  <head>
    <title>Variables in JavaScript</title>
    <script>
      // Variable declaration and assignment
      var message = "Hello, world!";

      // Output using console.log()
      console.log(message);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- HTML content -->
  </body>
</html>
```
In this example, the variable message is declared and assigned the value "Hello, world!". The value of the variable is then outputted using console.log()


## Data Types in JavaScript
JavaScript supports various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and more. Here's an example that demonstrates different data types:


```<html>
  <head>
    <title>Data Types in JavaScript</title>
    <script>
      // String
      var name = "John Doe";

      // Number
      var age = 25;

      // Boolean
      var isStudent = true;

      // Array
      var hobbies = ["reading", "coding", "gaming"];

      // Output
      console.log(name, age, isStudent, hobbies);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- HTML content -->
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, variables are assigned values of different data types, including a string, number, boolean, and an array. The values are then outputted using console.log().
