# Day 3: Operators and Expressions

In this section, we will explore the concept of operators and expressions in JavaScript.

## Topics Covered

### Arithmetic Operators

```javascript
var a = 10;
var b = 5;
var addition = a + b; // 15
var multiplication = a * b; // 50
```
### Comparison Operators

```
var x = 5;
var y = 10;
var isEqual = x == y; // false
var isNotEqual = x != y; // true

```
### Logical Operators
```
var isTrue = true;
var isFalse = false;
var result1 = isTrue && isFalse; // false
var result2 = isTrue || isFalse; // true

```
### Assignment Operators
```
var num = 10;
num += 5; // num becomes 15

```
